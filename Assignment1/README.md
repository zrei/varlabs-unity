There are two scenes: Part1 scene holds the terrain assignment for part 1. In this scene, you can
toggle through 4 different camera views using the C key.

Part2Menu holds instructions for how to play part 2. Part2 scene holds the actual gameplay. Roll
around the level with WASD/Arrow Keys and try to collect as many fruits as possible without falling
out of the map. Floor tiles can move and the walls are bouncy.

You can either start playing from the MainMenuScene which has buttons to bring you to part 1 or part 2.
There's no button to return back to the main menu though so you will have to quit the game to switch parts.
Either that, or you can start playing directly from Part1 or Part2Menu scene.
